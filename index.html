                Words have many biases embedded into them based on the way we
                use them every day. U.S. adults spend more than half their day
                consuming media, and it’s paramount we recognize what gender
                labels are being perpetuated in the news and the internet. This
                visualization looks at 3 billion words used in English news
                articles shared through Google News in 2019, and plots how close
                each word is associated with the male or female gender.

                  This visualization looks at how common certain words are used
                  with gendered pronouns such as “he” and “she” in the news.
                  This was done by looking at 3 billion words and analyzing 300
                  billion of their usage associations from articles shared
                  through Google News (found
                  <a

                  >
                    here</a
                  >). These 3 billion words were converted into high-dimensional
                  vectors based on these associations using Word2Vec, which
                  allows word associations to be measurable.

                <p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">
                  To visualize the gender association, the word vectors are
                  manifold folded into two-dimensional space by a T-SNE
                  algorithm and projected on a two dimensional line between “he”
                  and “she” using Pandas. This allows any words to be measured
                  on a gender spectrum. The selected categories are made by
                  finding that specific word in high-dimensional space, and
                  gathering the closest 500 words to it, which are then plotted
                  on a beeswarm graph in D3.

                <p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">
                  The way this visualization was made sends an equally important
                  message beyond just gender labels in the news. The process
                  used here is common as a preprocessing step to text-based
                  machine learning. Unfortunately, our models have learned to
                  capture the biases present in the real-life data on which we
                  train them. When we train our machine learning models on
                  embeddings like these, a recruiter searching for "programmers"
                  will leave female resumes at the bottom of the pile. Gender
                  bias needs to be mitigated in these models or gender biases
                  will continue to perpetuate.
